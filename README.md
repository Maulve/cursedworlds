# Cursed Worlds
Adds a few cursed and broken world types.

Select the type of world in the world creation screen, or alternatively, (mainly on servers) set the gamerule `cursedWorldTypeId` to one of the following, to change the cursed world type:
```
0: None, 1: Tall Cliffs, 2: High Mountains, 3: Blox/Islands, 4: Broken Amplified, 5: Bumpy/Spiky, 6: Spiky/Cliffs, 7: Holes/Spiky, 8: Mangrove Stripes, 9: Mountains/Walls, 10: Brutalist Stone Architecture, 11: Islands/Shrooms
```
After setting the game rule, a server restart is required for the changes to take effect.
